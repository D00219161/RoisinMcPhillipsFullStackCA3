Server side:
Created a new DB called Films-db
Added in a films collection and an actors collection
Linked both collections to the server side code - created an actor route and an film route along with a new Actor and Film models
Updated and added neccessary data to my App.js file so that I could view both collections on localhost:3000

Client side I have added my film files - Film.jsx, Films.jsx and AddFilm.jsx - These print out all film data from db to the client and is running on port 3001

I have made my commit messages after each change was made to each file.
